the identity percentage is 92.53968253968254% between Human and Mouse 
the BLOSUM62 distance is 3137.0 between Human and Mouse
the identity percentage is 91.74603174603175% between Human and Rat 
the BLOSUM62 distance is 3107.0 between Human and Rat
the identity percentage is 96.82539682539682% between Rat and Mouse 
the BLOSUM62 distance is 3261.0 between Rat and Mouse
The greater the BLOSUM62 distance is, the more similar their sequences are.
So according to BLOSUM62 distance and percentage identity, human SLC6A4 gene sequence is more like the mouse than the rat, and mouse and cat is more like each other than human.
