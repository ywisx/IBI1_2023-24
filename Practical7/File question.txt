Python file code start line number: 32 (assuming modified code counts from line 1)  
  
Results Discussion:  
The trend of DALYs in the UK over time can be seen by plotting a line graph. The graph shows whether DALYs in the UK have risen, fallen or remained stable year on year.  
If DALYs are falling, this could mean that the UK is making progress in disease control and health management.  
If DALYs are rising, the reasons may need to be further analyzed, for example there may be a rise in the incidence of specific diseases or health management practices are not effective enough.  
Analyzing the data points in the graph can help us understand trends in DALYs in the UK and may guide future policy development and interventions.
