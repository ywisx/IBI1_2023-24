After reading and understanding the text of the above material in depth, I have a clearer understanding of the SIR model, or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, which is an important tool used to study the dynamics of infectious disease transmission in populations. It is based on three basic assumptions: that susceptible individuals may contract the disease, that infected individuals may transmit the disease to susceptible individuals, and that infected individuals may recover and become immune to the disease.

Through this study, I deeply appreciate the important role of mathematical models in solving practical problems. At the same time, I also recognize my deficiencies in programming and data processing, which need to be improved in my future study.
